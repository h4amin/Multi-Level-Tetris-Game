# CS 246 Quadris Project
Final project for CS 246 at uWaterloo, in the Fall 2017 term- Quadris, a variant of Tetris containg a 11 x 15 board and 4 different kinds of blocks. As in tetris, you can have to create consecutive rows which disappear once filled. Everything then shifts down by one unit and continues until blocks hit the top. There is one big difference between Quadris and Tetris: it is not real time.
